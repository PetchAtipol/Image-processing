# Bike Detector Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV to detect bikes in a video. The script loads a video file, applies a trained classifier to detect bikes, and displays the video with rectangles drawn around the detected bikes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)

## Installation

To install the required Python package, you can use pip:

```bash
    pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

 - Place your video file in the Bike_Detector/Sample/ directory
 - Ensure the bike detection classifier (two_wheeler.xml) is in the Bike_Detector/Classifier/ directory

## Run the Script

```bash
    python bike_detector.py
```
## Exiting the Program

 - The video will continue to play until it ends or you press the e key to exit
